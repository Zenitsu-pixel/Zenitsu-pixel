****Syed Safwan ***Ali Hussaini**

I'm a dedicated [[computer science]] student pursuing a BSc degree, driven by a passion for technology and innovation. I'm proficient in specific programming languages or skills and eager
to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. Beyond the digital realm, I find joy in outdoor activities like football and cricket. As an avid [[anime]] enthusiast, I draw inspiration from 
series like Hunter x Hunter and Blue Lock. When the opportunity arises, I love exploring the world through travel and experiencing the thrill of driving, particularly in high-performance vehicles 
like the BMW M5 and M4 G82. *In-sha-Allah*
